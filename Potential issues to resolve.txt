takeQuiz.java:
	in takeQuiz:
		getAnswer(correctAnswers, questionNumber); // CURRENT FIX FOR NOT CALLING GET ANSWER ON LAST LINE OF FILE
		// Need to find a dynamic fix for it
	in getAnswer:
		if (correctAnswers.indexOf(userAnswer) == questionNumber) {}
      		// Potential issue could be caused if the same correct answer is in multiple Qs
      		// indexOf will return the FIRST index with the answer
      		// so if the same answer is done twice it will only count the first
		// https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_string_indexof.htm
		// FIX - rework how it checks answers
		// Currently each correct answer is added one at a time, only just before the question is answered by the user (in printValues()) 
		// Could be changed to make it a single variable rather than keeping a list (bc is the list really necessary at that point?)
		// Would allow for it to be directly compared rather than checking for indices


OR Would it just be easier to compare user input directly to correctAnswers(questionNumber)????


Minor changes?
- Would it just be easier to let user choose answer with [a, b, c, d] or [1, 2, 3, 4]
	- Might make the comparison a tad harder but still
